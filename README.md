# Rust

Programs of all sizes and complexity written in Rust, with some useful docs and other stuff.

## What kind of programs will be included?

This repository will contain some basic programs.

- Hello World!
- Basic Text Input/Output
- Adding Calculator
- Fibonacci Sequence Printer

In addition, I will try to incorporate multithreading into each program to maximize performance.

## Platform

These programs were written with `rustc 1.35.0` on `Xubuntu 18.04.2 LTS`. I'm not sure if they'll work on Windows, but any recent Linux distribution should work fine.
